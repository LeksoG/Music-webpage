      And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
      And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication
      It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
      The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
      It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
      Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
      Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?
      First born unicorn
      Hardcore soft porn
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
      A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
      And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
      Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
      And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?
      And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
      Born and raised by those who praise control of population
      Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
      First born unicorn
      Hardcore soft porn
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication
      Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
      And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
      And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
      Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
      Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
      First born unicorn
      Hardcore soft porn
      Dream of Californication
      Dream of Californication

      Look... If you had... one shot... or one opportunity...
      To seize everything you ever wanted... one moment...
      Would you capture it? Or just let it slip?
      Yo

      [Verse 1]
      His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
      There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
      He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
      to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
      what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
      He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
      He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now
      The clock's run out, time's up, over - BLAOW!
      Snap back to reality, OHH! there goes gravity
      OHH! there goes Rabbit, he choked
      He's so mad, but he won't
      Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
      He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
      It don't matter, he's dope
      He knows that, but he's broke
      He's so sad that he knows
      when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
      back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shift
      He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

      [Chorus]
      You better - lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go (go)
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better - lose yourself in the music, the moment
      You own it, you better never let it go (go)
      You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
      This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
      You better..

      [Verse 2]
      Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
      This world is mine for the taking
      Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
      A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
      close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
      Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
      These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
      He's known as the Globetrotter
      Lonely roads, God only knows
      He's grown farther from home, he's no father
      He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
      But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
      These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
      They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
      He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
      is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
      But the beat goes on da-da-dum da-dum da-dah

      [Chorus]

      [Verse 3]
      No more games, Imma change what you call rage
      Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
      I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
      I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
      But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
      Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
      All the pain inside amplified by the
      fact that I can't get by with my nine to
      five and I can't provide the right type of
      life for my family, cause man, these God damn
      food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
      There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
      And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder
      Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
      Caught up between bein a father and a pre-madonna
      Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
      stay in one spot, another day of monotony
      has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
      to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
      Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not
      Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
      I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
      So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
      This may be the only opportunity that I got

      [Chorus]

      [Outro]
      You can do anything you set your mind to, man.
